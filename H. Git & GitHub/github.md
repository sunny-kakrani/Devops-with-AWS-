## What is Github ??

* It is version control software.

* __GitHub__ is a cloud platform which is used to store project related files/code.

* __Git__ is a version control software which is used to communicate with GitHub 

* In gitHub, we can create source code repository to store project code.

* All the developers can connect to project repository to store all the source code (__Code Integration will become easy__)

* GitHub repository will monitor all code changes.

   * __Who modified the code__ .
   * __When the code modified__ .
   * __What code modified__.
   * __Why the code modified__

> As a Devops engineer , we are responsible to take the code from the __GitHub__ , we need to __Compile__ the code , we need to __Test__ the code , we need to __Review__ the code , we need to __Package__ the code and we need to deploy that code into the server .

## What is GitHub Repository ?

* Repository is a place where we can store project source code / files.

* For every project one repository will be created. 

* We can create 2 types of repositories in GitHub.

   * __Public Repo__ : Anybody can see and you choose who can commit.
   * __Private Repo__ : We choose who can see and commit.

> As a DevOps engineer , we are responsible to create the repository in the Github.

## Environment Setup :

* Create account in www.github.com

* Download & Install git client software

* Open __Gitbash__ and configure your name and email.

  * __$ git config --global user.name "your-name"__
  * __$ git config --global user.email "your-email"__
   > Configuring name and email is just one time process.


## Architecture of the GitHub and various useful GIT commands:
 
  ![alt text](image.png)

 * __git init__ :  It will initialize one empty git Local Repository __(.git hidden folder will be created)__

   > __.git folder__ It is the local Repository which contains the information of Central Repository .
   
   > __We can't execute the git commands from any folder until the .git folder is not present there.__

   > __fatal: not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git__ : This issue comes when .git folder is not present in the working tree

 * __git status__ : To Check the status of the Working tree.

 * __git add__ : This command is used to add the files in the Staging area .

   > In staging area we put those files which we want to commit .

* __git commit__ : This command is used to move the files from Staging area to the Local Repository .

* __git push__ : This command is used to push the files from the Local Repository to the git Central Repository .
   
   > __NOTE :__ When we use the git push command for the first time in GitBash  , It will ask the password to enter , You can use the __Git token__ at that time . It is not recommended to use the __Git password__ , It is recommended to use the __Git Token__ instead of a password . 

   > __NOTE :__ When we are pushing the changes to the Repository for the first time , We need to establish the connection between the Working tree and the Central Repository. __(Configure the Remote Repo URL by executing the below three commands)__

     * __$ git branch -M main__

     * __$ git remote add origin https://github.com/sunny-coder97/axis_app.git__

     * __$ git push -u origin main__
     * ![alt text](image-3.png)

     > Once the Connection is established , We can directly use __git push__  command.

     > __NOTE :__ While using the __git push command__ , only those files will be pushed to the Central Repository , which are commited in the Local Repository.

     

* __git restore__ : Below are the two usages of git restore command .

   * To discard the changes when the file is in unstaged state 

       * __$ git restore f1.txt__

   * To unstage the file when it is added to staging area .

      * __$ git restore --staged f1.txt__
    
* __git log__ : This command is used to see the commit history (It shows how many times we have done the commit to the remote repo)

* __git clone__ : This command is used to download the complete repository from Central Repository to the Local Repository .

  > When we clone any repo from the Central Repo , by default __.git folder__ will be available and we can directly execute the git commands and the __working tree would be clean__ .

* __git pull__ : It is used to download only latest changes from Central Repository to Local Repository .

* __git rm__ : This rm command is used to remove the files / directory from the Central Repository . Suppose we have mistakently pushed the target folder in the git remote repo.
   
   *  __git rm file.txt__ : __For removing the file ,file will be staged by default and ready to commit.__
   
   
   * __$ git rm -r target [All the recursive files of the target folder will be staged by default and ready to commit]__
   * __git commit -m "Deleted target folder"__
   * __git push__

   > __rm command => rm command+ commit command + push command__ (__First It will be removed from local__ through rm command and then we will commit and push it )

* __git diff__ : It is used to display the differences between Working Tree and Central Repository .


## Git Branching :

![alt text](image-6.png)



* __Steps to create the branch on the remote repository :__

  * Cut the __develop branch/ release branch__ from the __main__ branch in the remote repository .

  * Do the __git pull__ to reflect the new branch that you have created on the Remote Repository in your Local Repository.

  * Checkout to the newly created branch , it can be Develop/Release or any branch.
    
    * __$ git checkout develop__ [ Now you are present at the develop branch]

  * Do the changes , commit and push , It will be reflected in the develop branch .

  * Once everything looks fine in the develop branch , we can merge the develop branch into the main branch that is called __Branch Merging__ 

    __Pull Request :__ In order to do the branch merging in real time , we create the PR's (Pull Requests)

* __Git Branching Strategy :__

   * Branching Strategy defines which branch we need to use and which branch will contain the latest code and from which branch we will do the production deployments.

     * __main branch__ - latest code 
     * __develop branch__ - for ongoing developments 
     * __feature branch__ - any complex task 
     * __release branch__ - prod deployments 
   
## what is .gitignore file ?

It is used to configure files or folders which we want to exclude from git commits .

__Ex:__ In maven project,  We shouldn't push target folder to git repository hence we can give this info to git using .gitignore file and we should __push that .gitignore file__ on the Central Repo.

__NOTE:__ If we want someone to do the code changes to our repository , we can make them as Collaborators 

## git fetch vs git pull 

* __git fetch:__ It identifies that there are some changes happened in the Central Repository , but those are not downloaded to the working tree. It will download after executing the __git merge command__

   * __git pull = git fetch + git merge__

__NOTE :__ We can avoid the conflicts by using the fetch command 

## How we can revert the commit from the Local Repository

* If we commit anything in local then the branch is ahead of that a particular commit and we should push that change , but If want to revert that commit from the local repository we can use th below command .

   * __$ git reset --hard HEAD~2__ (We will go to 2 commits back in the local repository)

## How to revert our code changes grom Git Central Repository :

  * There are two ways to revert the changes that we have pushed on the Central Repo .

    * Whatever the changes that we did and pushed to the Central Repository , We should revert those changes from the local and again use __git add , git commit and git push command__ __[NOT GOOD APPROACH]__

    * use the __git revert command__ like below :

       * $ git revert __`<commitid>`__ : By executing this command our branch will get reverted by the one commit in local __[Your branch is ahead of 'origin/main' by 1 commit]__

       * Now execute the __git push__ command to push the reverted commit .
## Git stash command :

This command is used to save our working tree changes to a temporary area for the future purpose . I dont want to commit and delete the changes for now but for purpose it can be useful for me .

   * __$ git stash__  [ Working tree would be clean after executing this command ]

   * __$ git stash apply__ : [All the preseved changes will come and we have to commit and push it according to our need]


## Git Conflicts Issues:

* Conflicts usually occur when we merge one branch into another branch , even in the case of __git pull__ also we merge the branch of Remote Repo into our Local Repo . At that time conflict can occur.

* There is no automatic way to resolve the conflicts , We always manually resolve the conflicts.

* __If conflict comes while during the pull in a specific branch , we need to follow the below steps:__

   * Resolve the conflicts manually .
   
   * After resolving the conflicts in the file , we need to stage the changes to mark the conflict as resolved by using the __git add__ command .

   * use __git commit__ command , it will generate a commit message indicating the merge was successfull .

   * use __git push__ now , because you have resolved the conflicts now .


__NOTE :__ In most of the cases we should not get conflicts when we are executing the commmand __git pull__ from the main branch , if conflict comes that means we are directly working on the main branch and doing the commits on that , we should not do like that , we should not disturb the main branch !!


## Git merge and Git rebase :


__Merge__ and __REBASE__  both are used to integrate the changes from one branch to another branch but in a different way. __It is an alternative to Pull Requests__

   * __git merge__ :

      * It preserves the non linear history of the commits and the new commit is added. 

      __NOTE :__ "merge" is very recommended whenever you are working on a branch on which multiple engineers are contributing it . 

      In the below example , suppose you are working on the feature branch and you have done multiple commits in the feature branch and parallely master is also getting updated by the peer developers . Now you want to test your functionality with all the changes that the developers have pushed into the master branch . In that case use __git merge master__  
      
      Execute the below commands :

         * git checkout master
         * git pull master
         * git checkout feature
         * git merge master
      In that case use __git merge master__ 

        * ![alt text](image-14.png)

   * __git rebase__ :

      * It preserves the linear history of the commits by __rewriting the commits__ and the new commit wont be added .

        ![alt text](image-16.png)
    
      __NOTE:__  __NEVER-EVER run the rebase command from the main/master branch__ , It will messup the commit history of the developers that they already commited into the main/master branch .

      __NOTE:__ Always use git rebase on a branch where you are working it and no-one else is contributing to it .
