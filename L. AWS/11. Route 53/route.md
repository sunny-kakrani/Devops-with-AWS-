__NOTE:__ Lenghty URL's are difficult to remember , customers won't like the lengthy URL's to access the application . To promote our application ,  we need to map our application to beautiful domain name. So we need to purchase the domain name and we need to map our application to the domain name . 

### Why the name is only Route-53 ??
