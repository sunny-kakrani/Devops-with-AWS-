## AWS S3 (Simple Storage Service):

* S3 stands for simple storage service

* S3 is used for unlimited storage

* S3 works based on Object storage (object = file)

* S3 is a paid service (for storing & for retriving)

* S3 maintains data using buckets concept

* Buckets are used to seperate objects logically.
  Bucket means group of objects
  
    * __netflix_tollywood_movies_bucket__
	 * __netflix_bollywood_movies_bucket__
	 * __netflix_hollywood_movies_bucket__

__NOTE:__ When we create bucket, aws will generate one URL for that.

__NOTE:__ When we upload object in the bucket then object url will be generated.

* We can upload the objects in s3 bucket by the below following ways :

   * __<mark>Using Web Console__
   * __<mark>Using Programmatic access__ 

## Static Website hosting using S3 :

* Website nothing but collection of web pages.
   * __Ex: login page, register page, services, about us page, contact us page...__

* Websites are divided into 2 types
  
  * static website
  * dynamic website

* The website which gives same response/content for all users is called as __static website.__	

* The website which gives response based on user is called as __Dynamic website.__
