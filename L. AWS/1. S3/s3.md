## AWS S3 (Simple Storage Service):

* S3 is a storage service in AWS cloud.

* S3 supports unlimited storage.

* Using S3 we can store any amount of data from anywhere at anypoint of time.

* S3 supports object based storage (files).

* We can upload & download objects (files) at any point of time using S3

  * __One Object = One file__

* In S3, we need to create buckets to store data

__NOTE:__ In one bucket we can store group of objects.

__NOTE:__ Every bucket should have unique name.

* When we create a bucket, end-point url will be generated to access bucket.

* When we upload object into bucket, every object will get its own end-point url.

__NOTE:__  By default, buckets and objects are private (we can them as public).

* We can create multiple buckets in s3.

## Static Website hosting using S3 :

* Website nothing but collection of web pages.
   * __Ex: login page, register page, services, about us page, contact us page...__

* Websites are divided into 2 types
  
  * static website
  * dynamic website

* The website which gives same response/content for all users is called as __static website.__	

* The website which gives response based on user is called as __Dynamic website.__ 

__Git Repo:__ https://github.com/ashokitschool/s3_static_website_hosting

* Below are the steps to host the static website in S3 :

  * Create s3 bucket with unique name

  * Upload website files & folders into bucket with public read-access

  * Enable Static website hosting (in bucket properties)

     * index-document : index.html
     * error-document : error.html

__NOTE:__ After enabling static website hosting, it generates end-point URL for our website.

  * Access our website using website endpoint url.
